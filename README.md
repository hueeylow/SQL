# SQL Project Demo
Welcome to my SQL project demo! 

In this page, I will create a walkthrough demo using Housing BTO launch Price in May-2023:

<b> Approach </b><br>
(1) Create a Database with 2 Tables<br>
(2) Query results with conditions / set parameters<br>

#### (1) Create a Database with 2 Tables
With SQL client installed and localhost server ready, it's good to go create my database and tables structure. <br> I named my Database as <b> Housing_BTO_DB </b> and created 2 respective Tables, <b> Site_Location </b> and <b> Pricing_Model</b>.<br>
<br>
It is always a good practice to segregate critical info. Likewise in this example, pricing model into separate data table.
